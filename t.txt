Types of Cloud Services:
IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service): Provides users with virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking. 

PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service): Offers a platform for developing and running applications, including the underlying infrastructure. 
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service): Delivers software applications to users over the internet, with no need for local installation. 

Examples:

Google App Engine is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies building and deploying web applications. It provides a fully managed environment where developers can focus on coding without worrying about server provisioning or scaling. App Engine handles these tasks automatically, allowing apps to scale up or down based on demand. 

Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, often referred to as J.C.R. Licklider, is widely regarded as the "father of cloud computing". In the 1960s, he envisioned a global network that could connect people and data from anywhere, layin

EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, a web service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides on-demand, scalable, and secure computing capacity in the cloud. Essentially, it allows users to rent virtual servers (called instances) to run their applications in the cloud. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:

    Elastic Compute Cloud:
    The name "Elastic Compute Cloud" reflects the service's ability to dynamically scale computing resources up or down based on demand. 

The App Engine Admin API is a RESTful API provided by Google Cloud that allows developers to programmatically manage App Engine applications. It offers access to various administrative tasks, such as deploying new application versions, managing traffic distribution, and handling authentication. 
Understanding Cloud Computing: The AWS EC2 Instance | by Kate ...

EC2 instances are virtual machines running on Amazon's hardware. More specifically they are virtual servers. Just like a virtual machine, EC2 instances are guest machines run by hypervisors on host machines.4 Dec 2022

Cloud computing is a way of accessing and delivering computing resources, like software, storage, and infrastructure, over the internet. It eliminates the need to own and manage physical servers and allows users to access services on-demand and pay only for what they use. A common example is using online storage like Google Drive or iCloud to save files, or strea
