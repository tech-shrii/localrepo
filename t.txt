Types of Cloud Services:
IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service): Provides users with virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking. 

PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service): Offers a platform for developing and running applications, including the underlying infrastructure. 
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service): Delivers software applications to users over the internet, with no need for local installation.
